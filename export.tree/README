Notes:
1. Subject IDs 339, 369 and 394 do not have stimulation electrode location data available.
2. Electrodes are in chA-chB format (chA gets leading positive phase of the stimulation). This information is stored in the "channel" file for each stimulation run.
3. In some cases, two distant sites were stimulated simultaneously as indicated by the electrode listed under the appropriate run IDs within the ieeg folders.
